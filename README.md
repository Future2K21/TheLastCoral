# 🌊 The Last Coral

**A 2-Day Game Jam Collaboration between Pace University & Parsons School of Design**  
**Built in Unity | Designed for Arcade Cabinet Deployment**

---

## 🎮 Game Premise

You are a scuba diver tasked with saving the last living coral in the ocean. Rising CO2 levels are increasing the pH of the water, threatening to ossify the coral and destroy the reef's ecosystem. Work alone or with a partner to vacuum CO2 bubbles, manage your oxygen, and maintain the ocean’s health before it’s too late.

---

## 🧠 Core Gameplay

- **Main Conflict:** CO2 bubbles spawn and raise the ocean’s pH over time.
- **Main Objective:** Remove CO2 to stabilize the pH and protect the coral.
- **Main Goal:** Prevent the coral from ossifying and dying due to high pH.

---

## 🎯 Game Features

- **Omni-directional Diver Movement:** Swim freely in all directions underwater. Vertical movement is slower to simulate underwater drag.
- **Dynamic Coral Health System:** Coral takes damage if pH rises, but heals slightly if pH returns to neutral. Health recovery weakens over time.
- **CO2 Bubble Vacuuming:** Use your underwater vacuum to remove dangerous CO2 bubbles before they pop.
- **Oxygen Management:**
  - Players lose oxygen over time.
  - Regenerate oxygen at the surface.
  - Share oxygen in co-op by pressing a "blue button" near your partner.
  - In single-player mode, oxygen drains faster.
- **Environmental Hazards:** Fish swim through the water as distractions but do not deal damage.
- **Co-op Support:** Work together to clean the ocean and share oxygen to stay alive.
- **pH Meter System:** A colored and numbered pH bar shows the current ocean acidity.
- **Ambient Sound Design:** Features high-pass filtered and echo-rich underwater music to enhance immersion.
